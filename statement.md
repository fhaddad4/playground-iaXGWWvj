## Introduction
Are you looking for a way to convert scanned PDF to Textsearchable PDF ? then read this article, I have explained How to convert Scanned PDF to OCR (Textsearchable PDF) using C# and with the help of some addon tools

Many times we need to scan some files and use them, but as it is scanned and converted to picture format, we can not copy content of the file and it is of no use, so we need some technique which will convert that scanned image to some Text searchable document that can be copied easily,

In such cases we need OCR to convert image in to text. **Optical Character Recognition, or OCR,** is a technology that enables you to convert different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files or images captured by a digital camera into editable and searchable data.
This C# template lets you get started quickly with a simple one-page playground.

Are you looking for a code that will convert scanned PDF to OCR ? This article will help you more in order to accomplish your task.

## Let's start cooking

To create a tool which will convert scanned PDF to OCR we need following things.

Things need to collect

1. Ghost script
2. iTextSharp
3. tesseract-ocr
4. C#/ASP.NET (.NET framework 4 and above), Visual stud

**GhostScript :**
It is an interpreter for the PostScript language and for PDF. Ghostscript consists of a PostScript interpreter layer, and a graphics library. Sometimes the Ghostscript graphics library is confusingly also referred to simply as Ghostscript. Even more confusingly, sometimes people say Ghostscript when they really mean GhostPDL. The Ghost script can be download from here :

```C# runnable
// { autofold
using System;

class Hello 
{
    static void Main() 
    {
// }

Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

// { autofold
    }
}
// }
```

# Advanced usage
